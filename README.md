üìß Spam Message Detection using Machine Learning

This project implements a Spam Message Detection System using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques.
The model classifies text messages as Spam (1) or Ham (0) based on their content using Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms.

üöÄ Project Overview

The goal of this project is to automatically detect whether a given SMS message is spam or not.
The dataset used is the SMS Spam Collection Dataset, which contains labeled messages as either "spam" or "ham."

üß† Key Features

Text preprocessing using Regular Expressions, Stopword Removal, and Lemmatization

TF-IDF Vectorization for feature extraction

Classification using:

Logistic Regression

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Evaluation with:

Accuracy

Confusion Matrix

Classification Report


Source: Commonly available SMS Spam Collection Dataset (UCI Machine Learning Repository or Kaggle)
